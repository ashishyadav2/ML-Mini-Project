**Introduction:**
In the field of automotive sales, predicting car prices accurately can be a challenging task due to the multitude of factors that influence a car's value. This project aims to simplify this process using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique that can handle complex relationships between features and target variables.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project contains a comprehensive collection of car listings, each with a variety of features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor model.

**Installation:**
To get started with this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd car-price-prediction`
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Usage:**
1. Ensure you have the dataset (car_data.csv) in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (car_price_prediction.ipynb) to see the entire workflow.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the Random Forest Regressor model.
4. Experiment with hyperparameters, feature engineering, and other techniques to improve predictions.

**Results:**
The results of this project include insights into the predictive performance of the Random Forest Regressor model for car price estimation. The Jupyter Notebook provides visualizations, metrics, and explanations of the model's behavior. You can observe how different features contribute to the price prediction and gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing car prices.
